Right channel is a percentage of the left channel delay.
Output has a 12db boost to accomodate for some volume loss.

On Windows my images for the knobs are in my Pictures directory accessed via (File::SpecialLocationType::userPicturesDirectory) in myLookandFeel.h. You can change this if you would rather them some place else: https://docs.juce.com/master/classFile.html.
